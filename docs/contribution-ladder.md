## Maintainer

Maintainers are members with extra capabilities: 

* Be a code owner and have reviews automatically requested.
* Review pull requests.
* Merge pull requests.

Maintainers also have additional responsibilities beyond just merging code:

* Help foster a safe and welcoming environment for all project participants. 
  This will include understanding and enforcing our [Code of Conduct][conduct].
* Organize and promote pull request reviews, e.g. prompting community members, 
  contributors, and other maintainers to review.
* Triage issues, e.g. adding labels, promoting discussions, finalizing decisions.
* Help organize our development meetings, e.g. schedule, organize and 
  execute agenda.

Each logical set of repositories has a separate [team](https://github.com/orgs/cnabio/teams)
to manage its maintainers.

### How to become a maintainer
    
To become a maintainer, we would like you to see you be an effective
contributor, and show that you can do some of the things maintainers do.
Maintainers will do their best to regularly discuss promoting contributors. But
donâ€™t be shy, if you feel that this is you, please reach out to one or more of
the maintainers.
    
## Admin

Admins are maintainers with extra responsibilities:

* Create new mixin repositories
* Manage porter-* repositories
* Manage porter-* teams

Each logical set of repositories has a separate [team](https://github.com/orgs/cnabio/teams)
to manage its admins.

### How to become an admin

It isn't expected that all maintainers will need or want to move up to admin. If
you are a maintainer, and find yourself often asking an admin to do certain
tasks for you and you would like to help out with administrative tasks, please
reach out to one or more of the admins.
