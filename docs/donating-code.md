# Donating Code to the CNAB Project

The CNAB project has a history of collaboration across companies and countries
on the specification and its associated code bases. The
[CNAB GitHub organization](https://github.com/cnabio) is home to the
specification itself as well as reference implementations and helper libraries.
Much of the code found there was developed by one company or person and then
donated to the CNAB project. This document details what kind of code projects
are accepted into the CNAB project and what the process for donating them is.

## What kinds of projects are accepted

There are three types of projects that will be considered for donation:

* Reference implementations: example implementations of one or more portions of
  the specification
* Conformance testing tools: tools for testing CNAB compatibility
* Helper libraries: libraries that make implementing the CNAB specification
  easier

## Requirements for accepted projects

In order to donate a project:

* You or your company must own the code and be able to donate it
* You or your company must own the intellectual property associated with the
  code
  * Having a [DCO sign-off](https://github.com/apps/dco) is sufficient for this
* The code must be open source and licensed with a permissive license
  * [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or
    [Apache](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) are examples

## How to contribute a project

If the code that you would like to donate is owned by your company, follow your
company's internal process for open sourcing and donating the code.

Once you know that you can donate the code, contact one of the
[executive directors](../governance.md#the-executive-directors) via Slack or
email to let them know. They will setup a call with you to better understand
what you would like to contribute and why you would like to do so.

If the executive directors agree that the project could be accepted, you should
schedule a discussion about the donation as part of a
[community meeting](https://cnab.io/community-meetings/). This will ensure that
the community is aware of what is happening and give them a chance to give
feedback on the donation.

The final step is for the executive directors to alert the JDF to the donation
and to choose which working group will be responsible for it.
