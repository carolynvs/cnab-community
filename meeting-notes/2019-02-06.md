* Common repository for test data (client conformance) - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/90

    * If you are working on something, please submit a PR and list it on https://cnab.io/community-projects/


**NOTES**

* Introduction - everyone's awesome, again
* spec decomposition
    * different stabilities for different parts
    * should x be part of the spec?
* storage of CNAB bundles in registries
  * Gareth gives a quick background for the registry discussion
  * Steve L - it is agreed that we want to store additional artifacts in registris with the OCI folks, we are at the point where details are discussed.
  * how to let specific teams that are in charge of different artifacts own the specific artifact schema
  * anyone interested in this discussion, join the weekly OCI meeting, today (Wednesdays) at 2pm pst: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/linuxfoundation.org_i0sado0i37eknar51vsu8md5hg%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
  * OCI mailing list conversation: https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!topic/dev/oguystbnnw4

* additional repo with test data
    * we want to have a common place for test data to use with various implementations

* how to validate that a bundle is valid with a version of the spec?
    * the Python implementation already started some work on validation

**ACTION ITEMS**
* create a repo for a bundle validator
* create a common repo for test data
* Rename the bundles repo to bundle-examples or something to indicate its purpose better (that they show what a bundle looks like with the raw CNAB spec, not duffle or porter, etc)
