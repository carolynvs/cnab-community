** NOTES **

- Chris Crone from Docker demoed cnab push -> promote -> pull 
    - [Docker App](https://github.com/docker/app)
    - Push Pull with [CNAB-To-OCI](https://github.com/docker/cnab-to-oci) 
        - Apache 2 license, feel free to use it
        - Question from Michelle: Do you calculate the hash locally or on push
        - Answer from Chris: On Push because it depends on the layers being archived in registry
        - Steve Lasker: still a burder on registry to understand how they are stored, registries may not have all info they need
        - Chris: We need to define annotations to define how to identify, later we can make a better solution
        - Question (from Radu): Is there a signed bundle story yet
        - Answer: We aren't doing signing yet
        - Question (from Radu): How do the artifacts arrive?
        - Answer: push referenced images first, then push invocation image, then push oci index
- Josh Dolitsky demoed Lupo and Moopo
    - Build porter bundles using [Lua]([https://www.lua.org/) and [Moonscript](https://moonscript.org/)
    - Created issue in Porter [#207](https://github.com/deislabs/porter/issues/207) to investigate how to integrate lupo and moopo more tightly with porter.
- Privileged invocation images - DO WE DO IT OR NOT
    - Duffle used to mount the socket all the time
    - We've removed that
    - Question: other than demo scenarios, real world scenarios where you'd want to run privlidged invocation images (i.e. modifying the same docker engine that you're running in)
        - Handle we support that with --privledge? 
        - Chris: Don't do it by default, but you should have an option to tell the driver to run it as root, mount socket. Leave it up to the tooling.
        - Radu: do we have clear guidance on how to provide Docker URL and Certs for how to do production like things.
        - Chris: we've added docker context support for Docker CLI. It requires latest Docker app and docker CLi right now. You can specify contexts and it passes stuff in. 
        - Chris: Hope to contribute this upstream to Duffle (PR is up: https://github.com/deislabs/duffle/pull/661)
- Maineriners and LGTM+2
    - Michelle suggests the Helm policy for nominating maintainers
    - 2 LGTMs seems like a good idea now
- Issue 95:
    - Follow up conversation needed
    - Michelle might propose adding an artifacts manifest for thick bundles so tooling can know where to place things

** ACTION ITEMS **

* Michelle will PR a maintainers governance document based on Helm to nominate new maintainers
