**Notes**
* We are officially going to be a part of the JDF, just going through the paperwork over the next week (Matt Butcher). Choo Choo! üöÇ
* Request for comment on thick bundle relocation [duffle PR 741: thick bundle relocation](https://github.com/deislabs/duffle/pull/741)
* Parameters, JSON Schema and Required  (going to vote on adding $ to required to make it reserved) TODO:carolyn fill in
    * https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/178
* Add a 800 section for thick bundles? 
    * Condence the airgap issues into non-normative use cases (chris G)
    * Should we be storing vm's in OCI registries? Simon F suggests ORAS as a solution. Steve L says it's up to the artifact owner.
    * Need to be able to sha and checksum what is on disk (neccessary for airgap scenarios) Matt B.
    * Chris G - Need to be able to be able to make a binary blob that can hold multiple files (could be a VM) and we can evolve it over time with the spec. Need to get to V1 and iterate and get feedback from users. (CNAB oras artifact type?)
    * Lasker - Does a thick bundle even go into a registry or does it go onto a USB stick or CD? 
        * Chris Crone - Can't guarantee that anything exists, even by SHA so you have to include everything in the bundle.g
        * Radu - Need to make a distinction between 
* CNAB to OCI Demo - Chris Crone
    * DTR - Docker Trusted Registry
    * Use existing OCI registry infrastructure
    * We can push images and keep the signature the same (trust).
    * bundle.json is decomposed into metedata and saved as annotations in the registry
    * The bundle hash is based on the decomposed metadata (which doesn't have the registry part anymore, because the images references all reference images within the same registry at this point). This lets us relocate without rehashing. See Simon's comment for more context.
    * Simon F: You sign the OCI index once, you can rellocate and validate it against the original signature. If rellocating breaks digital signatures we think it breaks security requirements for some airgapped scenarios
    * ‚ÄúOPA‚Äù = Open Policy Agent see https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/1413
