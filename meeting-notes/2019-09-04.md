**Agenda**

- CNAB Core 1.0 vote
- https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/142 - is there anything in the discussion about thick bundles that is incompatible with Core 1.0?
- https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/242 - display names for actions
    - action item - Carolyn will open a new issue on localization and internationalization (https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/262)
- https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/244 - expected behaviour for multiple invocation images
    - Chris: multiple invocation images should not have different behaviours, but should be dependent on platform / architecture
    - Matt Butcher: some label matching could be added, but the core intention was to only address one invocation image
    - Matt Butcher: I will take a look in the spec to clarify the usage
- https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/246 - downgrade installation by running the upgrade action?
    - Chris: logic lives in the run tool / invocation image, the spec should probably not be too prescriptive - it should be the bundle author's responsibility
    - Chris: there could be a non-normative section suggesting the UX, but the spec should not be normative
    - Chris: taking dependencies in account, this would get even more complicated
    - Urvashi: custom action for downgrade could be helpful, and a clarification to the specification would be helpful
    - Chris will PR the clarification
- clarifications - ready to close?
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/245 - clarify how outputs are stored in a claim
        - closing, can be reopened if needed, but it tackles the claims specification
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/247 - clarification of readOnly in definitions
        - Urvashi: readOnly and writeOnly are more "notes" and not validation in the JSON schema. 
        - Urvashi will PR the clarification for this issue
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/248 - clarification of writeOnly in definitions
        - Carolyn: recommends reading Ryan's comment on how JSON schema deals with writeOnly
        - Matt Butcher will PR a clarification to the spec
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/249 - clarification of default in definitions
        - Urvashi: how to deal with the combination of require and default set on a parameter (user should have no input, and runtimes must evaluate validation)
        - Carolyn: agreement, however outputs also use the same structure
        - Carolyn will PR a clarification to the spec
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/250 - clarify how to convert non-scalar parameters to string
        - right now we are marshaling them to JSON - if that is not in the specification, it should be, as it is the intended behaviour
        - canonical JSON solves the issue around numbers
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/251 - clarification on updating a claim result
        - related to the claims specification
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/252 - clarification on stateless actions and installation names
        - Matt Butcher will PR the spec
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/254 - clarification of digest validation wording - PR in flight
        - PR opened, needs review
- https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/237 - what happens after a failed install action?
    - Chris: this should probably be the responsibility of bundle authors, recommend some UX, but the spec should not be prescriptive
    - Chris will PR a clarification to the spec
- wording issues
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/39
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/258
    - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/259

        - Matt Butcher and Jeremy Rickard will PR the wording changes to the spec
 
 - Matt Butcher: the paperwork for JDF is done, all will be announced on Sept 10, and ideally the spec should be stable by then. Given that most of the changes discussed today are minor, can we do an online vote on Friday for the spec?
- Matt Butcher: voting procedure - all core maintainers of the spec are entitled to a vote, a 2/3 majority is needed. Once this passes, it is marked as a recommended draft, then final recommendation. The procedure itself can be open, in Slack, direct messages, or email - a PR would be the simplest  way forward.

 - Jeremy: 2-3 small changes per person - seems doable?
 - Urvashi: how about the state of Duffle ?
 - Radu, Jeremy: at this point we validated that all changes required by CNAB Core 1.0 can be implemented in Duffle / cnab-go
 - Urvashi: agreed
 - Chris: start moving towards RCs for Duffle / cnab-go
 
 - Radu: articles, thanks for feedback
 - Jeremy: demo for next week
