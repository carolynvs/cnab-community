### Notes

- The State of the Claims spec (Butcher)
    - Butcher takes the lead on getting the claims spec going again.
    - Sufficiently vague so that the tools can move around their home dirs without hating on the spec
- libcnab-rust (Butcher)
    - restarted work on the Rust library
    - anyone opposed to having a full runtime in Rust?
    - Suggestion to split out library and client/runtime so that people can consume it like we do cnab-go
    - Ruffles repo!
    - Need integration tests across both to ensure we have the same outputs
- [Make status.json a CNAB Output](https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/pull/290)
    - Hearty üëç all around 
- Security Spec Update
    - Spec: working on recommendations
    - Need people who know python to help with implementation
