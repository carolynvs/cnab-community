### Agenda
* Welcome new CNABBERS ðŸ¦€

* ***Please*** review:
    * known implementations for security spec - [`cnab-spec#288`](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/288)
      * Trishank: it's good to go
      * Carolyn will take a look
    * initial draft for registry spec - [`cnab-spec#362`](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/362)
      * Pushed to next week's agenda 
    * clarify how to verify and inspect in-toto metadata - [`cnab-spec#364`](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/364)
      * Trishank: very quick fix, should be easy 
      * Carolyn will take a look
    * add parameter sources custom extension - [`cnab-spec#365`](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/365)
      * Carolyn: still WIP
    * fix ULID generation - [`cnab-go#207`](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-go/pull/207)
      * Carolyn: this was fun!
      * Carolyn: if you were generating ULIDs in high volume, they stop being sortable in increasing order, so this PR fixes that
      * Silvin looked at it
      * Basically adds a lot of mutexes to ULID generation
      * If anyone has a better implementation, that would be great!
      * This PR fixes the issue for now
      * Carolyn ~~challenges~~ throws down the gauntlet for fixing this w/o locks
    * minimal supply chain example - [`signy#74`](https://github.com/cnabio/signy/pull/74)
      * Trishank: quickly finish some gaps and finalize it
      * Carolyn: why was this in signy?
      * Trishank: because we want signy to instantiate in-toto software supply chains for the user
    * verify in-toto metadata in OS or container - [`signy#75`](https://github.com/cnabio/signy/pull/75)
      * Trishank: need to sort the broken docker integration test with Radu
      * Carolyn: will this continue to work with containers?
      * Ralph: yes, containers will be default, with OS being an option

* CNAB Registry support updates
    * The Harbor container registry now has CNAB support (Radu / Ralph)
      * Ralph: Harbor said go ahead and test CNAB against them
      * It works locally, even if a little flaky
      * CNAB icon is now next to bundles!
      * Works on DigitalOcean 50% of the time
      * GitHub Registry expected to move to Docker distribution
      * Carolyn would like to move a demo from Porter to CNAB website
      * People can then send PRs
    * Question from Slack: CNAB support on Nexus and Artifactory registries
      * Carolyn: has anyone tried this?
      * Ralph: Artifactory _was_ very popular, but he doesn't run into them anymore
      * Carolyn: which aspects of the [OCI compliance report](https://github.com/bloodorangeio/oci-conformance/tree/master/distribution-spec) are critical for `cnab-to-oci` to work?
