* Radu: Security implementation is underway in signy (PR 80)
* Jacob: DataDog is using ORAS in prod to reference bundles and push bundles, working on pushing terraform artifacts as OCI artifacts.
    * Radu: heads up you won't be able to use signy because it uses cnab-to-oci.
    * Jacob: May need to swap out ORAS with cnab-to-oci, we use generic artifacts which is why we did ORAS.
    * Radu: Let's talk over at next security meeting.
    * Chris: When using oras, how are you tracking artifacts in the registry?
    * Jacob: Indexing everything outside of the registry. Query and build the UI using a separate graph db.
    * Jacob: Want to be able to tie back OCI artifacts through the pipline to source control.
* Radu: We merged the first draft for the registry draft, please take a look!
