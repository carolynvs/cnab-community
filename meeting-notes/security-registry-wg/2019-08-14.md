**Agenda**

 - progress update on `cnab-to-oci` pushing the entire bundle and generating the relocation map - https://github.com/docker/cnab-to-oci/tree/relocation-map
     - Silvin and Radu working on cnab-to-oci
     - Relocation Map allows unmutated bundle to be stored as a complete thing
     - Because pushing entire bundle + canonicalized form, always same digest
     - Content Digest can be checked for bundle and images
     - Relocation map points to a different repo but same digest
     - Relocation map injected at runtime to invocation image
     - Enables an e2e demo (Radu will show at the end)
     - Nothing changes in OCI index, only changes bundle storing part, no breaking parts
     - No longer rebuilding the bundle, just pulling as is
     - Still relies upon annotations on oci index or distribution 
     - Trishank: not reconstructing, just using relocation to pull from own repo
     - Radu: yes, if any digests don't match relocation, runtimes must error out
     - Justin: is there a design?
     - Radu: that's the purpose of this meeting, want to walk through again?
     - Radu: when you push a bundle, we construct an OCI index, push all referenced images to a repository in reg, then store bundle itself as a blob in registry. BEcause entire bundle stored and canonical, can digest it and all pulls should be the same
     - Justin: still confused about relocation
     - Radu: because bundle references image and image includes registry, if you want to move to a different registry, you automatically invalidate the content of bundle if you modify it. If you sign it and move to a registry, and registry generates same digests, we generate at runtime a "relocation map" that points to new location and has content digest, tools make sure digests are the same
     - Map is generated from existing images in bundle.json and new images in your registry (oci index)
     - Justin: How is that used at runtime? how does it know what map to generate?
     - Silvin: when you pull, registry generates it
     - Radu: only way to ensure that you move things to new registry and not invalidate bundle because image names are part of bundle
     - Trishank: concerns: 1.) what is our common use case, looks like you're going to trust bundle to tell you where to fetch things. one way to solve is bundle doesnt tell me where to download, just has bundle
     - Justin: but you need to have image name in order to pull a hash. Not sure if that's strictly needed, the security model says you basically have to prove you have a hash or have auth for a named repo before you pull it, can't make a sha up and magically download contents
     - Trishank: adding image name doesn't really give you additional security
     - Justin: no just tells you where to check auth against, someone with same perms as you pushed it so ok to pull it
     - Radu: I can move an image and not change content digest, can i do that with trust data
     - Justin: in principal yes
     - Radu: is this a reasonable approach?
     - Justin: i think so, it feels weird but i think it's reasonable
     - Trishank: as long as you don't download the relocation from somewhere random on internet
     - Justin: it doesnt matter its just telling you where to auth against
     - Trishank: not silently ignoring digests so thats ok
     - Justin: hashes will be the same, just re-routing where to get them from. kind of imagine system where we can just have URLs for content hashes and we indirect on how to authorize them
     - Trishank: use case here is I want to move a bundle from one registry to another (probably private is most common use case)
     - Justin: would like to think if we can make a more generic mechanism later
     - Radu: we should start writing this down and getting people to validate
 - pushing images on `duffle push` - https://github.com/deislabs/duffle/issues/734
     - related to how cnab-to-oci does that
     - silvin: first thing we do is push or mount all images into same repository so we can ref form oci index. has some advantage like guarantee if you can pull oci index, you can pull all images (invo and component images), prevents garbage collection
     - cnab-to-oci expects things to already be pushed to respective repository, question is: how should tooling handle this?
     - should tooling push images before or should library that pushes the bundle push them as well?

 - mutating the bundle on first `duffle push` - adding image digests and size

 - overview of the security draft (Trishank) - https://github.com/trishankatdatadog/cnab-spec/blob/trishankatdatadog/301/300-CNAB-security.md
     - see recording for overview of draft + overview of how DataDog uses TUF/in-toto in CI/CD
     - Time ran short, the PR is open soon. 
- demo of a proposed workflow for sign -> push -> verify (Radu M)
    - Radu showed a video, refer to the recording
