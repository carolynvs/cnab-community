        - [#304](https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/pull/288)
    * [Signy](https://github.com/engineerd/signy) does thick bundles and handles credentials properly for generic registry / notary pairs
    * we're looking for people to help a Python implementation of the security spec, if you want to help, let us know

    * the work in `cnab-to-oci` SIGNIFICANTLY simplified the dependencies going forward for all Go projects
    * OCI Spec - sync
    
**Notes**

 * Trishank discussed 301
 * Radu discussed 304
 * Radu wants help on Python implementation for 304
   * Trishank volunteered
 * Radu: where to get in-toto root layout signing key from?
   * Trishank: maybe just reuse TUF root key for now
   * Trishank: we can also reuse Notary support for Yubikey to keep this root key
 * Radu: TLDR - we want an implementation-independent spec that uses TUF and in-toto for CNAB Security (300)
 * Silvin: we should discuss how to merge `cnab-to-oci` with CNAB Registry (200)
   * All registries seem to break with `cnab-to-oci` right now
   * We should write the Distribution spec now even before we get all the approvals from OCI
