### Agenda

- declarative installation support - [#285](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/285) (Glyn, Ralph)
    - Glyn: Pivotal used CNAB for Alpha Software prior to VMware
    - Glyn:After VMware acquisition, some objections to CNAB
        - VMw likes the image list (bundle.json)
        - VMw dislikes the executable invocation image + opaque use of credentials
    - Ralph: Understand sensitivity and background of ActiveX
        - Mitigiation to ActiveX trust was digital signing
        - Nobody ever really checked those / trusted them
        - Some trust roots later discovered false
        - A CNAB bundle could do anything if you allow it
        - Difference is technology here is all open / inspectable
        - Containers + Binaries could be inspected
            - Mount file system, extract it, compare hash, etc
        -  We should scope to ability to inspect contents in container is high enough and if shelling out is sufficient 
    - Justin: suspicious of inspectability given nature of modern software
        -  Working out what modern software is doing is very hard
    - Ralph: there are no production cloud native apps that know / validate all modules/libs they use
        - When you get into a distributed graph of vetting we don't do it
    - Trishank: notes that k8s binary is not even currently signed
    - Ralph: even if it were signed, that only helps you know it's what k8s says it is, people assume kubernetes is doing all the vetting (assumed trusted, nobody vetting)
    - Glyn: the point of introspecting a container really falls apart at examining a binary
        - Wouldn't satisfy VMw use case, want purely declarative installers
    - Ralph: want to see what can be done, but need to examine problems.
    - Jacob: minimum is image sig validation. Static analysis is a non-starter
        - Opened a couple of follow up issues (extensions) :
            - https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/337
            - https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/338
            - A new layer - address how credentials are being used and what doing
            - A third layer - a dry run like approach to render what will be applied to a cluster for validation and compute what permissions are actually required for a stateful action next time around and create kubeconfig with exact permissions (down to the resource name level) - highest level of security
    - Chris: could use ephemeral credentials as well and track exactly what happened. Need to decide what to mitigate against, what vectors are and layers become super important
    - Jacob: extensions designed to not require spec changes but provide progressive enhancements
    - Glyn: those are good building blocks, Joe Beda's comment in the issue summarizes the kind of tool VMware is looking for. Top of the spectrum is no invocation image, just metadata packaged with the bundle. Tool can inspect metadata and do what it wants. Next layer down is well defined invocation image, can be trusted via sha (next best thing), then the opaque invocation image. VMw desireability is the first two, invocation image being necessary part is a sticking point. If invocation image is optional then it becomes more attractive  
    - Jacob: that's in one of the extensions. Doesn't really see a difference between k8s cli and trusted invocation image with the bundle. If we have a standard way of referencing manifests via an OCI artifact, can swap out the invocation image 
    - Glyn: That's the middle spectrum that Joe laid out. 
    - Jacob: Runtimes could do the talking to k8s cluster or an invocation image could be used, basically the same. 
    - Glyn: Not quite the same because you're allowing executable things into the bundle vs a purely declarative tool
    - Ralph: what Jacob is saying: nothing preventing a runtime from identifying manifest resources based on annotation and swapping out to a trusted invocation process
    - JAcob: yes if we have this custom extension that identifies how to pull the manifests that will be applied, they can handle anyway they see fit (use an invocation image they build themselves, other trusted thing)
    - Ralph: process is key part, could be in container or could be on local machine. Concern: wish to have our flexibility to modify the specification but i don't think it's necessary to modify spec to obtain same gurantees. Middle point in Joe's spectrum is in scope of current spec
    - Glyn: point about the spectrum - middle point is probably applicable to some part of community, top of the spectrum (purely declarative) is probably more applicable 
    - Roundup : we will work through the two issues in up above and iterate to see how we can get to the point that works for everything 
- CNAB Registries spec update (Radu, Chris)
- CNAB Security - delegations update (Trishank)
    - TUF specification supports delegation
    - Does Notary V1 support out of box?
    - What are minimum set of changes needed for notary v1 so delgation can work
    - Matt: Notary is not interested in upstream commit to fix thing for v1
        - Point raised for V2
    - Ralph: will arrange conversation with Justin to confirm
    - One thing we could do instead of forking notary, we could hard code how delegation done
        - Not ideal, ok for MVP
        - Radu: suspect we could change behavior outside notary alltogether
    - Matt: either way we have to tell people how to do it, forking notary seems least desirable unless we have to change bundle format. Skeptical layering on a external security model will be good  
    - Radu: not external model, just picking what key
    - Matt: but still another tool and need to pick keys for different scenarios
    - Matt: taking over a big part of what notary does if we build our own tool
    - Trishank: yes proposing a tool w/in our reference impl that expects delegations to be sorted out in a specific way, any other way will break or may not work. 3rd option is upstreaming but has to be backward compatible with how notary works
    - Radu: the tool would be signy
    - Matt: largely a client side process that sounds more palatable
    - Trishank: We are OK with forking notary, but we prefer not to
    - Trishank: Docker restricts you to using the targets and delegation role (delgation +1) in practice.
